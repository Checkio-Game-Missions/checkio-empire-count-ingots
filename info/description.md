Ingots in each consignment are numbered in the row from A1 to Z9 as
A1, A2,..., A9, B1, B2, ..., Z9. Each consignment is marked with the number of the last ingot in it.
So you can define the quantity of ingots by the number of marks.

You are given a report of daily consignments as number marks written in a string separated by commas.
Count the total quantity of ingots. 
Take the report "A2,B1" for example. Here we can see two consignments with 2 (A2) and 10 (B1) ingots, giving us a result of 12.
