    For accurate accounting all ingots in cargo are numbered.
    Ingots in each consignment are numbered in the row from A1 to Z9 as
    A1, A2,..., A9, B1, B2, ..., Z9. Each consignment are marked by the last ingots in it.
    So you can define the quantity of ingots my marks.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a report of daily consignments as marks written in string separated by commas.
    Count the total quantity of ingots. For example, "A2,B1" -- here we can see two consignments with 2 (A2) and
    10 (B1) ingots, so the result is 12.
